A: Snake game: Make a classic snake game using TDD. To remind you the (minimum) rules of snake (you can make more features if you like):

•	You control a the direction of a continuously moving snake, going up, down, left or right – the snake cannot stop moving.

•	At any point in time, there is an apple somewhere on the playing field.

•	When the snake’s head runs into the apple, the snake’s body gets longer.

•	The snake dies if it runs into its own body, or a wall (if your game has walls). If the game doesn’t have walls, the snake should wrap around (like in Pacman).

•	The winning state is to run out of space.

•	Choose a point system of your liking. Inspiration:

–	Point(s) added for each apple eaten

–	Point(s) subtracted when starving (e.g. no apple eaten for an amount of time)
